NEW NOTES AFTER HIATUS
read: previous notes, while mostly imcomprehensible, will stay up 
new notes will be added and new to do items will be created from bottom-up



GENERAL 

*
problem: entry items coming from API need to have both a company Id as well as a company name
solution: mongoose join (populate) method 

*
problem: create format time util function that converts time from a decimal into a hours + minutes worked

*
problem: rework entire components and features folders -- determine which components should be placed in what folders 

*
problem: useAddCompanyVal.js file (path: features/auth/hooks) should be placed in user/hooks/validation folder

*
problem: useAddSignupVal.js file (path: features/auth/hooks) should be placed in user/hooks/validation folder

*
problem: validation hooks must be complete word 'val' -> 'validation' otherwise to confusing. Could mean value. 

*
problem: either have inputs be a separate component or individual for each

*
problem: axios stringify & node server convert request body date times into different timezone 
many date times need to reflect local time zones. 
solution: create system that preserves local time zones. 

*
problem: input components created both as an abstract general component (path: components/form/) and as individual inputs 
for specific components 
solution: all inputs should be created from the general NumInput/TextInput components 

*
problem: create 'something went wrong error message" as distinct component 

*
problem: two components ErrorMsg & ErrorText should be combined into single component

*
problem: certain feature specific components are placed in the general component folder



ADD COMPANY 

*
problem: styles: not enough margin on top of component

*
problem: inputs take up too much horizontal space within form component

*
problem: more space required between inputs 

*
problem: company list initial data should be pulled from DB not created locally 
what if user reloads page? or steps away for a while?

*
problem: Edit Company and Cancel buttons are not inline

*
problem: 'are you sure you want to continue' modal bugs out. Something is wrong with the chakra ui modal 

*
problem: add company on ProfileCreation page should have option to permanently set totalSalesApplicable = false/true


HOME

*
problem: All API calls on the home page should produce one loading state 
if any one API call fails, the entire page should render 'something went wrong' component


ADD ENTRY

*
problem: company switch (company select) does not effect Total Sales Applicable value

*
problem: if totalSalesApplicable = false, disable Total Sales input   

*
problem: tooltips should be added to confusing inputs
-total sales "the amount sold.. helps us determine a tip percentage."
-total Sales Applicable "if the amount that you sold is known, check the box." 
-special event "party, banquet, etc. This allows us to determine earnings on both regular and special shifts."  

*
problem: combine handlers into single fn

*
problem: on success after add entry needs to produce success icon as well as oppurtunity to 
add another entry or close 

*
problem:
Add entry arrow symbol needs to flip upon button press


*
problem: Total Sales Applicable value needs to change upon CompanySelect value as well as manual control


EDIT ENTRY
*
  Problem: Edit Entry (within Add Entry form) fill button does not work 
  Desc: fill button click does not populate form with proper date, does not close modal
  Solution: Unsure

*
  Problem: Edit Entry modal overlay does not close upon fill,cancel (btn), X(btn), esc(key press), click off 
  Solution: find reddit comment from previously asked question


*
Problem: Add Entry function does not create all fields specified in Entry model 
Solution: rework Add Entry function 

*
Problem: Add Entry function - company select - needs to be or point towards an object id 
of that specific company or position
Solution: match company id and position to company array within node server - grab object id in backend 



OVERVIEW 

*
problem: onLoading and onError UI states are not rendered

*
problem: find more interesting data to display to the user

problem:

*
problem:



DAY 

*
problem entry data needs to be pulled from separate API 
pull all entries back a year 
if user selects date prior to 1 year of most recent date within entries data pool 
create new API request

*
problem: is not intuitively linked to week section 

*
problem: requires its own day picker

*
problem: remove base data & add queries 

*
problem: requires a tag upon that describes if entry was last input 


*
problem: add date picker - set to current date 
have current date present all shifts worked for that day
allow user to select which shifts' data gets presented to the stats section

problem:


WEEK

*
problem: EntryDisplay box needs access to company name

*
problem:a shift preview should provide option to send data to Day statistics view

*
problem: popover display a few more pieces of data and a populate button will send info to single entry stats view

*
problem: week date box requires 'day' text i.g., 'sunday', 'saturday', 'monday'

*
problem: day displayed does not match the weekPairs data. select dates: (9-15) DateBox dates: (8-14)  

*
problem: Week needs to display its data -- wait until full combover of front-end components is acheived
Too many components will get used that I don't fully understand yet

*
problem: shifts are not being placed in the correct days

*
problem: weekpairs in Week component is a poor name. It's not a pair its just a week.

*
problem: Week Shift popover 'view' button needs to populate single entry data


MONTH 

*
problem: Month section does not have a title 



SHIFT

*
problem: shift section needs to be created
