*fix: Week Section 
backend: data will be array of entries
front-end:
-create component that contains the seven day boxes
-pass date state var into fn that takes 2 args (date: Date, entries: Array) 
create var = entriesByDay : Array {day: String, entries: Array}
take date and create 7 days from monday - sunday add to entriesByDay array 
loop through entriesByDay array and nest loop entries array 
if entry (month, day, year) are equal to entriesByDay day (month, day, year)
place entry into entriesByDay entries: array 
return entriesByDay


GENERAL 
*currently selected company needs to be saved on user model

*
problem:  create generic react-query error handler

*
problem: DefaultText component should be modifed by the chakra ui extend themes section 
There is no reason to have a separate component for that.

*
problem: entry items coming from API need to have both a company Id as well as a company name
solution: mongoose join (populate) method 

*
problem: create format time util function that converts time from a decimal into a hours + minutes worked

*
problem: axios stringify & node server convert request body date times into different timezone 
many date times need to reflect local time zones. 
solution: create system that preserves local time zones. 


ADD COMPANY 

*
problem: styles: not enough margin on top of component

*
problem: inputs take up too much horizontal space within form component

*
problem: more space required between inputs 

*
problem: company list initial data should be pulled from DB not created locally 
what if user reloads page? or steps away for a while?

*
problem: Edit Company and Cancel buttons are not inline

*
problem: 'are you sure you want to continue' modal bugs out. Something is wrong with the chakra ui modal 

*
problem: add company on ProfileCreation page should have option to permanently set totalSalesApplicable = false/true


HOME

*
problem: All API calls on the home page should produce one loading state 
if any one API call fails, the entire page should render 'something went wrong' component


ADD ENTRY

*
problem: company switch (company select) does not effect Total Sales Applicable value

*
problem: if totalSalesApplicable = false, disable Total Sales input   

*
problem: tooltips should be added to confusing inputs
-total sales "the amount sold.. helps us determine a tip percentage."
-total Sales Applicable "if the amount that you sold is known, check the box." 
-special event "party, banquet, etc. This allows us to determine earnings on both regular and special shifts."  

*
problem: combine handlers into single fn

*
problem: on success after add entry needs to produce success icon as well as oppurtunity to 
add another entry or close 

*
problem:
Add entry arrow symbol needs to flip upon button press


*
problem: Total Sales Applicable value needs to change upon CompanySelect value as well as manual control


EDIT ENTRY
*
  Problem: Edit Entry (within Add Entry form) fill button does not work 
  Desc: fill button click does not populate form with proper date, does not close modal
  Solution: Unsure

*
  Problem: Edit Entry modal overlay does not close upon fill,cancel (btn), X(btn), esc(key press), click off 
  Solution: find reddit comment from previously asked question


*
Problem: Add Entry function does not create all fields specified in Entry model 
Solution: rework Add Entry function 

*
Problem: Add Entry function - company select - needs to be or point towards an object id 
of that specific company or position
Solution: match company id and position to company array within node server - grab object id in backend 




OVERVIEW 
*
problem: onLoading and onError UI states are not rendered

*
problem: find more interesting data to display to the user 



ENTRIES
*
problem: date conversion!!! mismatch! somewhere along the shiftDate pipeline createEntry, stringify, send to server, send to DB, send back to server, parse, stringify, send to react, parse, 
somewhere within this pipeline the date is being converted into separate time zones
therefore when a new entry is created, its original date value is being converted. 
This problem also extends into the week of days component  

shiftDate: variable pipeline: 
- state variable in AddEntryForm - local timezone 
-converted into timestamp 
-sent to node server 
-stored in mongoDB as timestamp: Number
- that number is, when run locally in chrome browser, converted into the correct time


*
problem: EntryDisplay box needs access to company name

*
problem: week date box requires 'day' text i.g., 'sunday', 'saturday', 'monday'

*
problem: day displayed does not match the weekPairs data. select dates: (9-15) DateBox dates: (8-14)  

*
problem: shifts are not being placed in the correct days

*
problem: weekpairs in Week component is a poor name. It's not a pair its just a week.


MONTH 

*
problem: Month section does not have a title 



SHIFT

*
problem: shift section needs to be created
