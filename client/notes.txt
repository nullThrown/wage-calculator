NEW NOTES AFTER HIATUS
read: previous notes, while mostly imcomprehensible, will stay up 
new notes will be added and new to do items will be created from bottom-up



GENERAL 

*
problem: rework entire components and features folders -- determine which components should be placed in what folders 

*
problem: useAddCompanyVal.js file (path: features/auth/hooks) should be placed in user/hooks/validation folder

*
problem: useAddSignupVal.js file (path: features/auth/hooks) should be placed in user/hooks/validation folder

*
problem: validation hooks must be complete word 'val' -> 'validation' otherwise to confusing. Could mean value. 

*
problem: either have inputs be a separate component or individual for each

*
problem: axios stringify & node server convert request body date times into different timezone 
many date times need to reflect local time zones. 
solution: create system that preserves local time zones. 

*
problem: input components created both as an abstract general component (path: components/form/) and as individual inputs 
for specific components 
solution: all inputs should be created from the general NumInput/TextInput components 

*
problem: create 'something went wrong error message" as distinct component 

*
problem: two components ErrorMsg & ErrorText should be combined into single component

*
problem: certain feature specific components are placed in the general component folder



ADD COMPANY 

*
problem: styles: not enough margin on top of component

*
problem: inputs take up too much horizontal space within form component

*
problem: more space required between inputs 

*
problem: company list initial data should be pulled from DB not created locally 
what if user reloads page? or steps away for a while?

*
problem: Edit Company and Cancel buttons are not inline

*
problem: 'are you sure you want to continue' modal bugs out. Something is wrong with the chakra ui modal 

*
problem: add company on ProfileCreation page should have option to permanently set totalSalesApplicable = false/true


HOME



ADD ENTRY

*
problem: company switch (company select) does not effect Total Sales Applicable value

*
problem: if totalSalesApplicable = false, disable Total Sales input   

*
problem: tooltips should be added to confusing inputs
-total sales "the amount sold.. helps us determine a tip percentage."
-total Sales Applicable "if the amount that you sold is known, check the box." 
-special event "party, banquet, etc. This allows us to determine earnings on both regular and special shifts."  

*
problem: combine handlers into single fn

*
problem: on success after add entry needs to produce success icon as well as oppurtunity to 
add another entry or close 

*
problem:
Add entry arrow symbol needs to flip upon button press


*
problem: Total Sales Applicable value needs to change upon CompanySelect value as well as manual control


EDIT ENTRY
*
  Problem: Edit Entry (within Add Entry form) fill button does not work 
  Desc: fill button click does not populate form with proper date, does not close modal
  Solution: Unsure

*
  Problem: Edit Entry modal overlay does not close upon fill,cancel (btn), X(btn), esc(key press), click off 
  Solution: find reddit comment from previously asked question


*
Problem: Add Entry function does not create all fields specified in Entry model 
Solution: rework Add Entry function 

*
Problem: Add Entry function - company select - needs to be or point towards an object id 
of that specific company or position
Solution: match company id and position to company array within node server - grab object id in backend 




*
problem: overview section doesn't have proper title 

*
problem: overview 'Tip amount per hour' is useless data piece

*
problem: Day section does not have a title

*
problem: Day section is not intuitively linked to week section 

*
problem: Day section requires its own day picker

*
problem: Week section does not have updated weeks 

*
problem: Week section calendar specific shifts does not fit 

*
problem: Week section calendar specific shift needs to be pop up 

*
problem: Month section does not have a title 

*
problem: shift section needs to be created
