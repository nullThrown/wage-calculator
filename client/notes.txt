GENERAL 
*currently selected company needs to be saved on user model

*
problem:  create generic react-query error handler

*
problem: entry items coming from API need to have both a company Id as well as a company name
solution: mongoose join (populate) method 

*
problem: create format time util function that converts time from a decimal into a hours + minutes worked




ADD COMPANY 

*
problem: styles: not enough margin on top of component

*
problem: inputs take up too much horizontal space within form component

*
problem: more space required between inputs 

*
problem: company list initial data should be pulled from DB not created locally 
what if user reloads page? or steps away for a while?

*
problem: Edit Company and Cancel buttons are not inline

*
problem: 'are you sure you want to continue' modal bugs out. Something is wrong with the chakra ui modal 

*
problem: add company on ProfileCreation page should have option to permanently set totalSalesApplicable = false/true


HOME

*
problem: All API calls on the home page should produce one loading state 
if any one API call fails, the entire page should render 'something went wrong' component


ADD ENTRY

*
problem: company switch (company select) does not effect Total Sales Applicable value

*
problem: if totalSalesApplicable = false, disable Total Sales input   

*
problem: tooltips should be added to confusing inputs
-total sales "the amount sold.. helps us determine a tip percentage."
-total Sales Applicable "if the amount that you sold is known, check the box." 
-special event "party, banquet, etc. This allows us to determine earnings on both regular and special shifts."  

*
problem: combine handlers into single fn

*
problem: on success after add entry needs to produce success icon as well as oppurtunity to 
add another entry or close 

*
problem:
Add entry arrow symbol needs to flip upon button press


*
problem: Total Sales Applicable value needs to change upon CompanySelect value as well as manual control


EDIT ENTRY
*
  Problem: Edit Entry (within Add Entry form) fill button does not work 
  Desc: fill button click does not populate form with proper date, does not close modal
  Solution: Unsure

*
  Problem: Edit Entry modal overlay does not close upon fill,cancel (btn), X(btn), esc(key press), click off 
  Solution: find reddit comment from previously asked question


*
Problem: Add Entry function does not create all fields specified in Entry model 
Solution: rework Add Entry function 

*
Problem: Add Entry function - company select - needs to be or point towards an object id 
of that specific company or position
Solution: match company id and position to company array within node server - grab object id in backend
