        *check math for calculations done in create entry route & update entry route
    
    *test calculate data function 
      -will most likely need to be reconfigured considering data is now coming directly from collection document  
    *look at business folder & clean it up
      -most of these files are useless, however, make sure to check to see if any logic is still useful 
      
    *create $grouping of shift data
