NOTES 

  Server  
    *calc data function must be placed outside of mongoose virtuals 
      -virtuals do not run on queries completed via pipeline aggregation  
      -place logic inside of 'entries/create' & 'entries/update' routes 
      -add new properties where the value is calculated in JS routes
    
    *complete get shift data route
      -filters: day,shiftTime,company
    *look at business folder & clean it up 
      -test data object -- make sure it is accurate 

    *retest mongoose virtuals -- make sure they are accurate

    *test all routes using postman -- double check math  
    

      ✔- POST - create new earning's entry
      ✔- POST - update earning's entry
      
      - GET - all entries + overview data
        -filters : All, Active, by specific company
          -perhaps switch name to overview 
          -'active' filter needs to take an indeterminate number of company IDs 
      
      - GET - data by specific month
        -filters: All, Active, by specific company
      
      - GET - data by specific week
        -filters: All, Active, by specific company
      
       - GET - shift data 
        -filters: All, Active, by specific company
      
       - GET - single entry (probable deletion)


        - this last route will be difficult to create 
        - will need to apply filters of some sort 
        - filter application will need to be a dynamic process 
        -first will need to figure out which filters to actually apply
        -second will need to send those filters to backend and figure out 
          how to dyanmically apply them to DB call

    *new folder name for business    
    *business logic needs to be cleaned up
      -many of these files are useless 
      -better names to be applied to factory functions 
    *data needs to be derived for best shift
  
  React 
    *clean up components folder 
    *add config for axios & react-query 
    *look into features folder in bulletproof React 
      -try to map the functionality from there onto this project 
    *try to map react-query axios calls onto backend API   
    *add providers into separate file
