    Lets write this all out. We are trying to convert an array of entries into usable data. 
    there are  four major components that require data at this point. 
   
    Overview 
    month
    Day
    bestShift

    the data for Overview and month are the same. It just requires a different set of entries to be run through a factory function 
    that spits out a calculated form of data. Much of this calculation can be done through mongoose virtuals. Keep the business logic as close to the database as possible.

    Overview - the properties of the overview object... Can these calculations be done within the Database as well ?
    Month - will the virtuals be applied to the list of subdocuments selected or will the virtuals be run on every subdocument?
          - It appears that the virtuals will run on only the subdocuments that are being queried and pulled
    Day - most of this data should be calculated by the database 
    bestShift - I still need to figure what type of data should be displayed here..

    EndPoints - have different endpoints for each piece of data you want to access
     overview + all entries - for entries plus overview data -- unless overview data can be accessed by virtuals 
      month - selects entries for only a given month and returns the virtual data associated with those given entries
      week - selects entries for a given week nad returns the virtual data associated with those given entries
      day - returns all entries that match a given day -- all data needed should be attached to that document
      bestShift - might be done by virtuals but could be too difficult ???

      react query 
       - will make calls to each one of these endpoints in concurrent API calls
       - will also be able to make single calls based on when specific components data is changed


       todo 
       - calc Data object returned from entries virtual still needs some work 
          - some null values are returned 
          -can we use this. to access not just doc fields but also virtuals from same doc??
          -split up calcData object -- it is way too large and ugly. confusing!!
        - go over react components and rework all calculations that will be needed
          - it seems that both overview, week, and day data can all be the same 
        
        - create virtual in Entries model that returns a single calcData object 
          - this calc object will be used for overiew, month, week data
        - create virutal in Entry model that returns single calcData obj 
          - this calc object will be used for day datat 
        -check if day data can be accessed via virtual properties
        -create endpoints for overview + entries data
        -create endpoint for month data 
        -create endpoint for bestShifts Data
