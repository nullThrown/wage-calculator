    Lets write this all out. We are trying to convert an array of entries into usable data. 
    there are  four major components that require data at this point. 
   
    Overview 
    month
    Day
    bestShift

    the data for Overview and month are the same. It just requires a different set of entries to be run through a factory function 
    that spits out a calculated form of data. Much of this calculation can be done through mongoose virtuals. Keep the business logic as close to the database as possible.

    Overview - the properties of the overview object... Can these calculations be done within the Database as well ?
    Month - will the virtuals be applied to the list of subdocuments selected or will the virtuals be run on every subdocument?
    Day - most of this data should be calculated by the database 
    bestShift - I still need to figure what type of data should be displayed here..
